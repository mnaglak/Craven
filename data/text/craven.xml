               instructors. From the large number of applicants I was among the 11 selected.
               However, being on fatigue I could not leave the barracks &amp; hence lost a chance to

            <p>During the <label type="military">afternoon drill</label> I again sat &amp; watched the fellows drill. Following the

            <p>In the <label type="military">afternoon drill</label> I was instructor of Detachment 7. Gave the fellows a stiff
